## Teaching Statement
My teaching philosophy is grounded in the belief that education should not only impart knowledge but also inspire inquiry, cultivate critical thinking, and prepare students for real-world applications. In my view, effective teaching is a two-way process that revolves around engagement, interaction, and mutual respect between the teacher and students.

I prefer to teach Environmental Economics and Applied Econometrics. I am also open to other related courses.
