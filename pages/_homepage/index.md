## About Me

Hi! I am an applied microeconomist working on environmental, health, and development issues. My research is characterized by a focus on real-world problems, a commitment to informing policy, and a dedication to interdisciplinary collaboration.   

I obtained my PhD. in economics from [National School of Development](https://www.nsd.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2022. Now I am a post-doctoral fellow in the [Faculty of Business and Economics](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/) at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). 

## Research interests

- Development Economics (aid; human capital)
