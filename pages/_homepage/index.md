## About Me

I have been a post-doctoral fellow in the [Faculty of Business and Economics](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/) at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) since August 2022. I am on the 2024-25 academic job market.

My research interests and approaches are characterized by a focus on real-world problems, a commitment to informing policy, and a dedication to interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly in the fields of Environmental Economics, Health Economics, and Development Economics.

## Fields of Interest

- Environmental Economics (environmental policy; climate change; water pollution; air pollution; green finance)
- Health Economics (environmental health; nutrition; health policy)
- Development Economics (aid; human capital)
